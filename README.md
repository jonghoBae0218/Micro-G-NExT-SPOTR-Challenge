## Abstract

The Columbia Space Initiative developed the Columbia SEE LION, a system that uses image recognition to identify life-saving objects near the Orion capsule crash site in the Pacific Ocean. The system features a single-board computer to run the recognition model and process live video from a camera. It identifies objects in the video and transmits results to an operator’s laptop via ethernet. Testing in the Neutral Buoyancy Lab (NBL) pool demonstrated successful identification of life rings and life rafts, and highlighted areas for improvement in user interface and functionality for future updates.
